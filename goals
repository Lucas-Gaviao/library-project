- Goal: We're going to create an app for a library (we'll have a CRUD functionality for books)

Model > Routes > Views

[x] READ list of Books - create a route: - Book.find () - create view: "books-list.hbs"

[x] READ details of a book - create a new route: GET "/book/:bookId" - req.params.bookId - Book.findById() - create a view: "books/book-details.hbs"

[x] CREATE a book - GET /books/create ---> Display the form - view with a form - POST /books/create ---> Process the form - create a new route - req.body
-Book.create()

[x] UPDATE a book - GET /books/:bookId/edit ---> display form
Book.findById(id) - POST /books/:bookId/edit ---> process form

[x] DELETE a book

## Goal: Allow users to create an account

    - GET / signup (Display Form)
        - view `auth/signup.hbs`
        -form (email + pw) --> POST

    - POST /signup (process form)
        - req.body
        - generate salt + hash
        - User.create()
